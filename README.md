# For Loop Explanation

In this document, we will discuss how to explain the logic behind a for loop to students. We will consider what demonstrations and images could be used to make the concept more accessible and engaging.

## Demonstration

To demonstrate the concept of a for loop, we can use a simple real-life example. Imagine a teacher who wants to call out the names of each student in a class to check attendance. The teacher goes through the list of students one by one, starting from the first student until the last one is called. This repetitive action can be compared to a for loop in programming, where a set of instructions are executed for a specific number of iterations.

Using this analogy, we can explain the given code snippet:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
  console.log("the current number is " + i);
}
```
## Details
The for loop acts like the teacher calling out student names. 
The loop starts with `i = 0` and continues until `i < 4`, increasing the value of `i by 1 (i++)` after each iteration. 
The code inside the loop, `console.log("the current number is " + i)`, is executed for each iteration, printing the current value of i.
